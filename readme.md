# Day 1 


---

## 📘  *Revised Assignment*
For this version of Day 1 project, I took my Syllabus for Week 3 of Unsupervised and Machine Learning Master's course and converted it to a one-page Markdown document, along with some thoughts on my project.  Then I fed the Markdown to the week3.py to display as HTML instead of your one-liner.  

It wasn't as easy as it looks for a *(somewhat)* newbie at Python and JavaScript full-stack developer.
